<p>Create a prediction from a set of pair-ended FastQ genetic sequences.</p>

<p>Both compressed and uncompressed files are accepted but the former are preferred.<br />Please label paired end FastQ files as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>isolate-name-here</i>_R1.fastq</li>
  <li><i>isolate-name-here</i>_R2.fastq</li>
</ul>
<p>Replace “<i>isolate-name-here</i>” with your desired isolate or strain name.
